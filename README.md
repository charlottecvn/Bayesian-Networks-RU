# Bayesian-Networks (Radboud University)
Code for assignments in the course Bayesian Networks at RU

## General Instructions:
To run the code of the first assignment, we used RStudio (Version 1.3.1093).

We got the data from https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/CEVAE/tree/master/datasets/TWINS (saved it and used this folder as 'Path_dir' in R).

After declaring, following libraries must be installed:
* plyr
* dagitty
* bnlearn
* lavaan
* tidyverse
* psych
* bayesianNetworks 

## Assignment 2 - Instructions: 
At the top of the R files, the variables and paths can be declared.
